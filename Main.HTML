<section id="overview">
    <h2>Country Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Mozambique or as it's offically called The Republic of Mozambique is a unitary presidential republic located in Southeast Africa, with a population of over 30 million. 
        After gaining independence from Portugal in 1975, the country experienced a lengthy civil war until the early 1990s. 
        Since then, it has functioned as a multiparty democracy with strong presidential authority, though challenges remain in transparency and electoral fairness.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="institutions">
    <h2>Political Institutions</h2>
    <p>
        The executive branch is headed by a president who also serves as head of state and government. 
        The unicameral Assembly of the Republic forms the legislature, while the judiciary is led by the Supreme Court. 
        Separation of powers exists in theory, but executive dominance is prevalent.

<section id="culture">
    <h2>Political Culture & Participation</h2>
    <p>
        Political participation is increasing, though voter turnout fluctuates. Media freedom is limited, with state control affecting objectivity. 
        NGOs play a vital role in advocacy and service delivery. Ethnic and regional cleavages can affect political alignment and access to resources.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="parties">
    <h2>Party and Electoral Systems</h2>
    <p>
        Mozambique uses a proportional representation system. The FRELIMO party has maintained dominance since independence, 
        while RENAMO serves as the main opposition. Elections are held every 5 years but have faced criticism for irregularities.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="changes">
    <h2>Political and Economic Changes</h2>
    <p>
        Mozambique has seen reform efforts in anti-corruption and decentralization. Economic development is driven by natural gas projects, 
        but inequality remains high. Recent global partnerships (e.g., China, IMF) play a key role in shaping policy direction.

<section id="comparison">
    <h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>
    <p>
        Compared to Nigeria and Iran:
        - Mozambique shares Nigeria's presidential system, but lacks its federal structure.
        - Unlike Iranâ€™s theocratic influences, Mozambique is officially secular.
        - Electoral fairness is more consistent in Nigeria than Mozambique.
    </p>

<section id="reflection">
    <h2>Reflective Response</h2>
    <p>
        What surprised me most was the level of centralized executive power despite being a democracy. 
        This project helped me understand how fragile democratic structures can be when institutions are not independent. 
        I would recommend reforms to ensure electoral transparency and stronger judicial independence in Mozambique.
